## **Description**:

Implement the Jajodia-Mutchler voting algorithm. Let there be eight servers, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. There is
only one data object X, replicated across the eight servers, that is subject to writes. Initially, the version number (VN),
replicas update (RU) and distinguished site (DS) values for X at all servers are 1, 8, and A, respectively. The rule for
selection of distinguished site favors the server that is alphabetically smallest among the candidates.

####  Requirements
1. You must attemp at least two writes in each of the network components show in Figure 1. A write can originate
at any of the servers in the corresponding partition.
2. After each write attempt, successful or unsuccessful, output the VN, RU, and DS values for each server
